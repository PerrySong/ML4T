# Financial Feature Engineering - How to Research Alpha Factors
This chapter will address the following topics:
1. Which categories of factors exist, why they work, and how to measure them.
2. Creating alpha factors using NumPy, pandas, and TA-Lib.
3. How to denoise data using wavelets and the Kalman filter. 
4. Using Zipline offline and on Quantopian to test individual and multiple alpha factors. 
5. How to use Alphalens to evaluate predictive performance and turnover using, among other metrics, the information coefficient (IC).

## Alpha factors
Alpha factors are transformations of raw data that aim to predict asset price movements.

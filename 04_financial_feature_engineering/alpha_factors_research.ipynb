    "**RSI**: Relative strength index:RSI compares the magnitude of recent price changes across stocks to identify stocks as overbought or oversold. A high RSI (usually above 70) indicates overbought and a low RSI (tipycally below 30) indicates oversold. It first computes the average price change for a given number (often 14) of prior trading days with rising prices and falling prices, respectively to compute RSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Price Momentum**: This factor computes the total return for a given number of prior trading days. In academic literature, it is common to use the last 12 months except for the most recent month due to a short-term reversal effect that's frequently ovserved. However, shorter periods have also been widely used.\n",

    "Stocks with low prices relative to their fundamental value tend to deliver returns in excess of a capitalization-weighted benchmark. Value factors reflect this correlation and are designed to send buy signals for undervalued assets that are relatively cheap and sell signals for overvalued assets. Hence, at the core of any value strategy is a model that estimates the asset's fair or fundamental value. Fair value can be defined as an absolute price level, a spread relative to other assets, or a range in which an asset should trade.\n",

More recently, the low -volatility factor has been shown to capture excess returns on stocks with below-average volatility, beta, or idiosyncratic risk.
